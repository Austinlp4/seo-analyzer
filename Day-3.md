# Week 1, Day 3: Enhancing SEO Analysis and User Authentication

## Day 3 Progress

Today, we made significant strides in improving the SEO Analyzer Tool:

1. **Enhanced SEO Analysis**:
   - Implemented a comprehensive `Analyze` function in the `seo` package.
   - Added various SEO metrics including title length, description length, H1 count, word count, page load speed, mobile-friendliness, responsive design, SSL certificate, and meta robots content.
   - Created a `calculateSEOScore` function to provide an overall SEO score based on these metrics.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implemented JWT-based authentication system.
   - Created `handleRegister` and `handleLogin` functions in the API package.
   - Added `HashPassword` and `CheckPasswordHash` functions for secure password handling.

3. **Frontend Improvements**:
   - Developed an `Auth` component for user registration and login.
   - Updated the `App` component to conditionally render the analysis form based on login status.
   - Enhanced the `ResultsDisplay` component to show detailed SEO analysis results.

4. **API Integration**:
   - Updated the `AnalysisForm` component to handle API requests and errors more robustly.
   - Implemented error handling for various scenarios in the frontend.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created an `AnalysisCharts` component to visualize SEO metrics using charts.

6. **Testing**:
   - Added initial unit tests for the `AnalysisForm` component.

7. **Project Structure and Build Process**:
   - Updated `build.sh` and `run.sh` scripts to streamline the development and deployment process.
   - Organized the backend code into more structured packages: `api`, `auth`, `models`, and `seo`.

## Next Steps

1. Implement database integration for user management and storing analysis results. [x]
2. Enhance the SEO analysis with more advanced metrics and external API integrations. [x]
3. Improve error handling and validation in both frontend and backend.
4. Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance for repeated analyses.
