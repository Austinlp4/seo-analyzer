# Day 1: Setting Up Our Project Structure

## Why Go and React?

Before we dive into the code, let's discuss our choice of technologies for this project: Go for the backend and React for the frontend.

### Go (Golang)

We chose Go for our backend for several reasons:

1. **Performance**: Go is known for its excellent performance and low resource usage, making it ideal for building scalable web services.

2. **Simplicity**: Go's straightforward syntax and built-in concurrency features make it easier to write clean, efficient code.

3. **Strong standard library**: Go comes with a robust standard library, reducing the need for external dependencies.

4. **Cross-platform compatibility**: Go's ability to compile to a single binary for various platforms simplifies deployment.

5. **Growing ecosystem**: The Go community is rapidly expanding, offering a wealth of libraries and tools for web development.

### React

For our frontend, we opted for React due to its:

1. **Component-based architecture**: React's modular approach allows for reusable, maintainable code.

2. **Virtual DOM**: This feature optimizes rendering performance, crucial for dynamic web applications.

3. **Large community and ecosystem**: React's popularity ensures a vast array of libraries, tools, and resources.

4. **JSX**: This syntax extension makes it easier to write and understand component structure.

5. **React Hooks**: These provide a more intuitive way to manage state and side effects in functional components.

## Project Structure

Our project will follow a common structure for a Go backend with a React frontend:
