# Week 1, Day 1: Setting Up the SEO Analyzer Tool Project

## Project Overview

This is the first project in a 30-week coding challenge I've undertaken. Each week, I'll be developing a new project to improve my coding skills and create a diverse portfolio of work.

## Project #1: SEO Analyzer Tool

For the first week, I'm building an automated SEO analyzer tool. This web-based application will allow users to input a URL and receive a comprehensive SEO analysis of the webpage.

### Planned Features

The tool will integrate with APIs such as Google PageSpeed Insights, Moz API, or OpenSEO to analyze various aspects of SEO, including:

1. Page load speed
2. Mobile-friendliness
3. On-page SEO elements (title tags, meta descriptions, header structure)
4. Content quality and keyword usage
5. Backlink profile
6. Technical SEO issues

## Day 1 Progress

Today, I focused on setting up the project structure and core components:

1. **Project Structure**: Created a directory structure separating the Go backend from the React frontend.

2. **Go Server**: Implemented a basic Go server with a custom file-based routing system to serve the React application and handle API requests.

3. **React Frontend**: Set up a minimal React structure using CDN-hosted React and Babel for rapid prototyping.

4. **Custom File-Based Routing**: Implemented a file-based routing system in the Go server to serve React pages and static assets.

5. **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Added Tailwind CSS via CDN for efficient styling of components.

6. **Development Workflow**: Created a shell script (run.sh) to start the Go server and watch for frontend file changes, streamlining the development process.

7. **Documentation**: Updated the README.md with setup and running instructions.

## Next Steps

1. Implement core API endpoints for SEO analysis
2. Expand React components for detailed analysis input and result display
3. Integrate with external SEO analysis services
4. Implement error handling in frontend and backend
5. Begin writing unit tests
6. Optimize server performance and consider adding a frontend build step if needed

## Conclusion

Day 1 has established a solid foundation for the SEO analyzer tool. The custom file-based routing system and Tailwind CSS integration provide a flexible structure for rapid development in the coming days.
