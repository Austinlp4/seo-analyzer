# Week 1, Day 2: Implementing Core API Endpoints and Expanding React Components

## Day 2 Progress

Today, I made significant progress on the SEO Analyzer Tool:

1. **API Endpoints**: 
   - Implemented a basic `/api/analyze` endpoint in the Go server to accept a URL for analysis.
   - Set up error handling for invalid URLs in the `seo.Analyze` function.

2. **React Components**:
   - Created an `AnalysisForm` component for URL input with error handling and loading state.
   - Developed a `ResultsDisplay` component to show analysis results.
   - Implemented state management for form submission and results display in the main `App` component.

3. **API Integration**:
   - Set up Axios in the React frontend to make API calls to the Go backend.
   - Implemented error handling for API requests in the `AnalysisForm` component.

4. **Initial SEO Analysis**:
   - Created a placeholder `Analyze` function in the `seo` package for basic URL validation.
   - Prepared the `AnalysisResponse` struct for future SEO metrics.

5. **UI Improvements**:
   - Enhanced the UI with Tailwind CSS for a more polished look, including responsive design and hover effects.
   - Added loading indicators for API requests in the `AnalysisForm` component.

6. **Testing**:
   - Wrote an initial unit test for the `handleAnalyze` function in the API package.

7. **Project Structure**:
   - Organized the backend code into packages: `api`, `models`, and `seo`.
   - Set up a proper React project structure with separate component files.

8. **Build and Run Scripts**:
   - Created `build.sh` and `run.sh` scripts to streamline the development and deployment process.

## Next Steps

1. Implement actual SEO analysis logic in the `seo.Analyze` function
2. Expand the analysis to include more metrics (page load speed, mobile-friendliness, etc.)
3. Implement caching for API requests to improve performance
4. Add more detailed error messages and validation
5. Enhance the results display with visualizations (charts, graphs)
6. Write more comprehensive tests for both frontend and backend
7. Begin implementing user authentication for saving analysis results

## Conclusion

Day 2 has seen significant progress in setting up the core functionality of the SEO Analyzer Tool. The basic analysis flow is now in place, from user input to displaying results, providing a solid foundation for further enhancements in the coming days.
